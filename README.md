# Hourly Tracker

Hourly Tracker is a tool for tracking when your workday is complete, given three variables:
1. The time you first logged in to your machine today.
2. The number of hours you plan to work today.
3. Your total idle time.

Tracking idle time is at the heart of what that Hourly Tracker provides. Whether you're on Windows or Linux, Hourly
Tracker uses OS built-in libraries to keep track of when your keyboard/mouse goes idle using a configurable threshold
(like 25 minutes, for example) before marking you idle.

This is perfect for hourly remote employees or anybody who maybe takes breaks in the middle of their workday for meals,
exercise, or appointments and errands, and doesn't want to have to manually keep track of how many hours they worked.
Say for example you logged into your work computer at 8:30am and you are planning to work an 8-hour day. You might just
stop working for the day at 4:30, but you spent roughly 90 minutes minutes away from your computer and you can't remember
exactly how long it was. Also, you worked extra hours into the night, more than your normally do. Now, you really have
no idea how many hours your worked today. You know roughly what time you started, roughly how much time you spent away,
and roughly how many extra hours but it's all a haze. Hourly Tracker tracks *all* of this for you.
